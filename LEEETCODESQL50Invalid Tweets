+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| tweet_id       | int     |
| content        | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
tweet_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains all the tweets in a social media app.
 

Write a solution to find the IDs of the invalid tweets. The tweet is invalid if the number of characters used in the content of the tweet is strictly greater than 15.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Tweets table:
+----------+-----------------------------------+
| tweet_id | content                           |
+----------+-----------------------------------+
| 1        | Let us Code                       |
| 2        | More than fifteen chars are here! |
+----------+-----------------------------------+
Output: 
+----------+
| tweet_id |
+----------+
| 2        |
+----------+
Explanation: 
Tweet 1 has length = 11. It is a valid tweet.
Tweet 2 has length = 33. It is an invalid tweet.

Solution:
select tweet_id from tweets where LENGTH(content) > 15;

Explanation:
SELECT tweet_id:

This part of the query specifies that you want to retrieve the tweet_id column from the database. The tweet_id typically represents a unique identifier for each tweet.
FROM tweets:

This specifies the table you are querying, which is the tweets table. This table presumably contains data related to tweets, including their content and IDs.
WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15:

The WHERE clause is used to filter the results based on a specific condition.
LENGTH(content): This function calculates the length (number of characters) of the content column, which contains the text of each tweet.
> 15: This condition checks if the length of the content is greater than 15 characters. Only tweets with content longer than 15 characters will be included in the results.
